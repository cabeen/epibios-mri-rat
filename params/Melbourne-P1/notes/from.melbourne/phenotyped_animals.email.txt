Hi Ryan,
 
I have attached the list of animals that we have included in the study for Project 1. Aim 1 animals have undergone only exvivo MRIs whereas Aim2 animals had MRI at 2d, 9d, 1month and 5 month time point in addition to the exvivos. The MRI files should be marked with the timepoints. The sheet has three groups for both aims- shams, TBI, TBI-epileptic.
Let me know if anything was unclear.
 
Regards
 
IDRISH
